    "### Merging these datasets\n",
    "The primary key formulated in Team 2's Primary COVID-19 dataset, labeled \"UID\", uses the state abbreviation appended to the \"CountyFIPS\". This is to provide a way to identify each county uniquely. In order to merge the super-table to these smaller tables one must be able to find commonalities between the datasets.\n",
    "#### Merging Weekly Hospital Capacity with Primary COVID-19 Dataset\n",
    "The primary key of the Weekly Hospital Capacity dataset is called \"Hospital PK.\" However, the Primary COVID-19 dataset does not include a reference to a particular hospital, just each county. The common variables between the two datasets is \"State,\" the abbreviated state name, as well as the county FIPS code (\"countyFIPS_cases\" in Primary COVID-19 dataset; \"FIPS Code\" in Weekly Hospital Capacity Dataset). Combining these two datasets emerges a possible correlation between the recent hospital trends/conditions with the total deaths/cases count of the last week. This could lead to correlating population total of a given area with the specific hospital conditions of the last recorded week."
